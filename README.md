# Fifteen

Fifteen is a very simple 2 player game built as a React PWA.

Try it out here - https://www.niranjanborawake.in/fifteen/

### Rules

- Players take it in turns to select 2 or 3 circles that total 15 in 15s.
- A player could select 2 circles, e.g. 7 and 8 or 3 circles, e.g. 4, 5 and 6.
- The last player who selects a combination of 15 is the winner.

Some features are WIP.
